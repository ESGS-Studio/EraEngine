# About

Era Engine is a modern ECS-based game engine that provides developers with powerful tools for creating 2D/3D games. It includes the following features and functionality:

### Entity Component System:
Era Engine uses ECS to manage game objects and their behavior. This allows developers to easily create and modify complex systems in the game.

### Rendering: 
The engine uses DirectX 12 to provide high-quality and efficient rendering, allowing you to create visually appealing games with advanced graphical effects. DLSS 3.5 and FSR 2.0 supported.

### Physics: 
Integration with PhysX 5.3.1 and CUDA provides realistic simulation of game physics, including collisions, GJK (overlapping, raycasting etc), gravity, aggregates, articulations, soft bodies, GPU particles, GPU clothes, joints, Blast Physics Destructions, Mesh destructions, ragdolls, vehicles, CPU-based tasks, physics event system etc.

### User Interface: 
ImGui is integrated into the engine to create intuitive and customizable user interfaces in games. 

## Audio:
Engine provides API and tools to work with 3D Audio. You can customize all audio settings and preferences to create realistic high quality sounds. 

### Scripting: 
Era Engine uses .NET 8.0 Native AOT and Runtime. This allows developers to write scripts in C# with all the benefits of .NET, including high performance and a rich class library.
